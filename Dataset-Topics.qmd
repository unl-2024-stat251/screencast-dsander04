[Link to dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/readme.md)

Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- The catchphrases said by the gang throughout the show's airing - could break it up by tv series - break it up by character - summarizing
- Air date of every episode/movie - compare number of episodes/movies aired by decade
- Visualize pretty much everything I can

Stat 251 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Catchphrases said
2. Dates of airing (could sort by decade)
3. What characters were caught by villains - could compare to what characters caught the villains
4. The voice actors - how many episodes/which characters were voiced
